# Personal Website V2 🚀🔥

Hello! Thanks for checking out the repo for my latest portfolio website. This website isn't just my new portfolio, but also a personal project in and of itself. I think I've grown quite a bit as a developer & designer in the past year, so I wanted to create something to showcase some of what I've learned and done.

## Getting started
- `npm install gulp-cli -g`
- `npm install`
- `gem install jekyll sass bundler jekyll-minifier jekyll-sitemap`
- `gulp serve` to start a dev server
- `gulp build` for prod

## What I used
- [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) my ride-or-die
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for easy push-to-deploy hosting
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for a static site generator
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for less time-consuming and more modular CSS
- [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) for sass mixins
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for an automated and enhanced workflow
- [Flaticon](http://www.flaticon.com/) for images
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for stock photos
- [Skrollr.js](https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr) for parallax effects
- [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) for a simple, sans-PHP contact form

Let me know what you think!
